<h1> What is Correlation </h1>
<p> Correlaiton is an association between two sets of variables which are linear. Furthermore, one variable effects the another, which in result is causation. Therefore, it can be determined correlation is used to discover the causations for the variables changing.
<h1> 3 Methods of Visualizing Relationships </h1>
<ol>
<li> Scatterplots are helpful when comparing linear lines while being able to visualize the data in the graph.  </li>
<li> A Matrix has the ability to compare lots of data at once. Correlation can be interpreted using a matrix, but usually is not as 
 helpful as a scatterplot</li>
<li> Parrallel Coordinates Plots, like a matrix, have the ability to compare lots of data and the correlation can be interpreted. Futhermore, 
 coordinates enhance the audience activity with the graph and data where features can be added.</li>
